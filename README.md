# Model Experiments

This repository contains some mock-ups of potential Gradle software definition models.
These mock-ups show examples of different patterns that we could use.
The focus is more on the model than the format.

There are two main questions these mock-ups attempt to answer:

**How does a developer declare what kind of software a project produces?**

See [Declaring software type](declaring-software-type.md)

**How does a developer work with software that has multiple targets?**

See [Software with multiple targets](multiple-targets.md)
