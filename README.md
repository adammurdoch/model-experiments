# Model Experiments

Some mock-ups of potential Gradle software definition models.

There are two main questions these mock-ups attempt to answer:

1. How does a developer declare what kind of software a project produces?
2. How does a developer work with software that has multiple targets? Almost all types of software can have multiple targets, and for some software such as Android, Kotlin multiplatform and native this is a fundamental aspect of the ecosystem.

This repository contains examples of different patterns that we could use. The focus is more on the model than the format.

- [Software with multiple targets](multiple-targets.md)
