## Software build outputs

A build output is defined by several aspects:

- Where is the output intended to be used?
  - Which "runtime" will it run in? Which version?
- Which software features does the output include?
  - Which optional features are enabled?
- Which development features does the output include?
  - Is the output signed? Obfuscated? Minimized? Optimized? Instrumented for profiling?

Just like the [software type](declaring-software-type.md), all of these aspects are all important things for a developer to decide on.
